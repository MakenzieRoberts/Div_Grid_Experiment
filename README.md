## 📝 Description

This tool provides a method for converting an image into a 1:1 grid composed of colored divs, where each pixel of the image is represented by a colored cell. It also generates HTML with inline styling for the grid, so it can be copied and pasted into your own project.

This project was a way of re-acquainting myself with vanilla JavaScript, following a semester of focusing on back-end Java. My goal for this project was to design a unique way to facilitate the generation of internet art, with a particular interest in producing animated pixel-art HTML image maps.

Any future projects I create using this tool will be linked here for easy access. 😊
